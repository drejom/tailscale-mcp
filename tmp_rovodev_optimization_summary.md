## ðŸš€ GitHub Actions Optimization Complete!

### âœ… What Was Fixed and Optimized

#### ðŸ”§ **Core Workflow Improvements**

- **Fixed incomplete release.yml** - Completed the truncated workflow file
- **Added proper NPM publishing** - Integrated NPM_TOKEN authentication and publishing
- **Updated deprecated actions** - Replaced actions/create-release@v1 with softprops/action-gh-release@v1
- **Added comprehensive Docker publishing** - Multi-platform builds with proper tagging

#### âš¡ **Performance Optimizations**

- **Added dependency caching** - Bun cache and node_modules caching across all jobs
- **Optimized job dependencies** - Build job no longer waits for integration tests
- **Added continue-on-error** - Integration tests won't fail the entire workflow
- **Environment variables** - Centralized BUN_VERSION and NODE_VERSION

#### ðŸ”„ **New Workflow Structure**

1. **ci.yml** - Main CI pipeline (lint, test, build, security)
2. **release.yml** - Automated releases with NPM and Docker publishing
3. **docker.yml** - Dedicated Docker image building and security scanning
4. **pr-checks.yml** - Fast PR validation (new)

#### ðŸ“¦ **Publishing Capabilities**

- **NPM Publishing** - Automated with proper authentication
- **GitHub Releases** - Auto-generated with changelog and installation instructions
- **Docker Images** - Multi-platform builds to GHCR and Docker Hub
- **Security Scanning** - Trivy vulnerability scanning for Docker images

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Required Secrets**

Add these to your GitHub repository secrets:

- `NPM_TOKEN` - For NPM publishing
- `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` - For Docker Hub publishing (optional)
- `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` - For Docker Hub publishing (optional)
- `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY` - For integration tests (optional)

#### ðŸš€ **How to Use**

1. **Push to main** - Triggers release workflow
2. **Manual release** - Use workflow_dispatch with release type
3. **PR creation** - Runs fast PR checks
4. **Push to develop** - Runs full CI pipeline

The workflows are now production-ready with proper error handling, caching, and publishing capabilities!
